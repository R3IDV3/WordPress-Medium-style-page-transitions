# WordPress - Medium-Style Page Transition
This is my implementation of Codrops' _Medium-Style Page Transition_ for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org).
## Getting Started
Find the write-up [here](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/10/30/medium-style-page-transition/) which inspired this WordPress implementation. It will help a lot to read this first!
## Notes
* This implementation works best if your theme is based off [Underscores](http://underscores.me).  
_Don't worry if it's not, you'll just have more tweaking to do on your own!_
